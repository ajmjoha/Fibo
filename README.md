# Fibo
## 
A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....
* In  
this program, we store the number of terms to be displayed in nterms . A recursive function recur_fibo() is used to calculate the nth term of the sequence. We use a for loop to iterate and calculate each term recursively.
