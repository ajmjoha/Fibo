# Fibo
## 
A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.... 
* In this program, we store the number of terms to be displayed in nterms . A recursive function recur_fibo() is used to calculate the nth term of the sequence. We use a for loop to iterate and calculate each term recursively.

* The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term.
